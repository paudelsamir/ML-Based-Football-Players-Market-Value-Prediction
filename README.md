# Football Players Market Value Prediction

This project predicts the market value of football players using machine learning models. The model is trained on various features such as player position, team, and other relevant data to estimate a player's market value. All the codes are publicly available on [This repo](https://github.com/paudelsamir/365DaysOfData/tree/main/04-ML-Based-Football-Players-Market-Value-Prediction)
